## Where Ascout stands

Ascout v0.2.0 is released on GitHub: https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/Ascout/releases/tag/v0.2.0 (published 2026-11-10, tag `v0.2.0` at `0741873`, tarball SHA-256 `43bd9c2e52389500ae5bc38b3595ff47e2a916794bef2e383dabfb2632b2bc63`, with a verified GitHub build-provenance attestation). It is not on npm. `v0.1.0` (2026-09-12) is superseded.

### Adoption plan (execution-first V0–V9)

| Packet | State |
| --- | --- |
| E1 Git command security | Done. Hostile repository Git configuration can't execute (`tests/git-config-hostile.test.ts`). |
| E2 truthful exits (A07) | Done. Exits 0 complete, 1 findings, 2 error, 3 source drift, 4 incomplete. |
| E3 notices | Done. The Gitleaks notice merged in #697. |
| E4 bounded execution broker | Done (`runQualifiedEngineV1`): pinned digests, empty environment, caps, source binding, owned process-tree teardown. |
| E5 Gitleaks | Done. `ascout security` runs Gitleaks 8.30.1 on Linux x64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64, qualified on real binaries in CI. |
| E6 test | Done. `ascout test` runs `check`; deep and release profiles report the engines that don't run yet. |
| E6 review | Advisory, opt-in. The founder authorized a local model on 2026-11-09. `ascout review --local-model` sends the changed lines only to Ollama on loopback (`qwen2.5-coder:7b` locally), never to a hosted service (#699, #700). Output is advisory and never human R1. Without the flag, or without the founder's config, review stays not run (exit 4). CI has no model and tests against a fake server. |
| E7 containment | T0 stated, T1 blocked. Every `ascout test` report carries a T0 trusted-local record (no filesystem or network isolation), and no profile predicts isolated execution any more (#702). T1 is blocked on FD-4, the private host spec, native proof, and human security review. |
| E8 optional MCP and end-to-end | Done. `ascout mcp` is a stdio MCP server with no socket and no options, offering four read-only tools (review without a model, security, doctor, test plan). It does not expose `check`, `test`, `init`, or the local model. Every result carries the CLI's JSON report unchanged and an `assurance` field, where a plan is never COMPLETE. Packets: design #703, command functions #707, server and M-1..M-15 plus E2E-1 #708, real Gitleaks over MCP on 3 OSes #709. The founder authorized proceeding on 2026-11-10; no line-level human R1 is recorded. |
| E9 distribution | Released v0.2.0 on GitHub only (#712, run 42874746620). The tarball is bit-identical on Linux x64, macOS arm64 and Windows x64 with Node 22 and 24, and qualified on each. A build-provenance attestation (SLSA v1) is verified. The founder waived both human reviews; neither was performed. |

### Security review (2026-11-08)

A whole-project security review found no critical issues. All high and medium findings and most low findings are fixed (PRs #667–#696); one is documented as a known limit (README, "Limits of the source fingerprint"). Two items remain: statement-level coverage, which needs a receipt version change, and repository settings (a `main` ruleset and Dependabot alerts), which are the owner's to change.

### Open decisions for the founder

- FD-4 for E7 containment.
- FD-8 for the historical plan PR #651, and ratification of #653.
- Repository settings: private vulnerability reporting and a `main` ruleset (PRs, linear history, the 13 required checks, no force push or deletion) are on as of 2026-11-10. Dependabot alerts are still off.
- Human R1 of the reconciled adoption packet (#653), and optionally of the E8 packets (#703, #707–#709), which merged on the founder's go-ahead without a line-level R1.
- Disposition of the older open planning PRs (#577–#635).

`ROADMAP.md` is the closed record of the REA engineering maintenance run (spec 018) and is kept as history.
